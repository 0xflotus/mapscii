* Use your mouse or keys to navigate
* Discover the globe or zoom in to explore your neighbourhood
* See Point-of-Interest around any given location
* Use an online map server or work offline with VectorTile/MBTiles
* Highly customizable styling (colors, feature visibility, ...)
* Compatible with Linux and OS X (Windows to be tested)
* 99% pure Coffee-/JavaScript! :sunglasses:



## How to get it?

* Make sure to have at least [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 4 installed

  `npm install -g termap`

## How to use it?
#### Basic usage
* Start `termap` with

  ` termap`


## Behind the scenes
### Libraries
#### Mastering the console
  * [`x256`](https://github.com/substack/node-x256) for converting RGB values to closest xterm-256 [color code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Xterm_256color_chart.svg)
  * [`term-mouse`](https://github.com/CoderPuppy/term-mouse) for mouse handling
  * [`keypress`](https://github.com/TooTallNate/keypress) for input handling

#### Discovering the map data
* [`node-mbtiles`](https://github.com/mapbox/node-mbtiles) for [MBTiles](https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec/blob/master/1.2/spec.md) parsing
* [`pbf`](https://github.com/mapbox/pbf) for [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) decoding
* [`vector-tile-js`](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-js) for [VectorTile](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/tree/master/2.1) parsing

#### Juggling the vectors and numbers
* [`earcut`](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut) for polygon triangulation
* [`rbush`](https://github.com/mourner/rbush) for 2D spatial indexing based label and mouse collision detection
* [`gl-matrix`](https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix) for vector and matrix operations
* [`breseham`](https://github.com/madbence/node-bresenham) for line calculations
* [`sphericalmercator`](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sphericalmercator) for [EPSG:3857](http://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/6864/) <> [WGS84](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/) conversions

### TODOs
* [ ] mouse hover
  * [x] of POIs/labels
  * [ ] maybe even polygons/-lines?
* [ ] termap-server - telnet and ssh access
* [ ] cli linking
* [ ] mapping of view to tiles to show
* [x] abstracted MapBox style JSON support
* [ ] giving render priority to features across layers (collect before render vs. direct)?
* [ ] line drawing
  * [ ] support for stroke width
  * [ ] support for dashed/dotted lines?
* [ ] label drawing
  * [x] support for point labels
  * [x] dynamic decluttering of labels
  * [x] centering text labels
  * [x] clipping fix when x<0 after repositioning
  * [ ] multi line label
  * [ ] label margin to avoid POI overlap?
  * [ ] translatable raster fonts
* [x] filled polygons
  * [x] convert polygons to triangles
  * [x] implement fillTriangle into drawille-canvas-blessed-contrib
  * [ ] respect fill/line style file based setting
* [ ] lat/lng-center + zoom based viewport
  * [ ] bbox awareness
  * [ ] zoom -> scale calculation
* [ ] Tile parsing
  * [ ] directly throw away features that aren't covered by any style
* [ ] TileSource class (abstracting URL, mbtiles, single vector tile source)
* [ ] tile request system
  * [ ] from local mbtiles
  * [ ] from remote url
    * [ ] permanent caching of received files
* [ ] zoom while keeping center
* [ ] API
  * [ ] setCenter
  * [ ] setZoom
* [x] start with zoom level which shows full vector tile
* [x] accurate mouse drag&drop
* [x] handle console resize
* [x] styling

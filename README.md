## Behind the scenes
### Libraries
#### Mastering the console
  * [`drawille-canvas-blessed-contrib`](https://github.com/yaronn/drawille-canvas-blessed-contrib/) for braille rendering
  * [`term-mouse`](https://github.com/CoderPuppy/term-mouse) for mouse handling
  * [`keypress`](https://github.com/TooTallNate/keypress) for input handling

#### Discovering the map data
* [`node-mbtiles`](https://github.com/mapbox/node-mbtiles) for [MBTiles](https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec/blob/master/1.2/spec.md) parsing
* [`pbf`](https://github.com/mapbox/pbf) for [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) decoding
* [`vector-tile-js`](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-js) for [VectorTile](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/tree/master/2.1) parsing

#### Juggling the vectors and numbers
* [`rbush`](https://github.com/mourner/rbush) for 2D spatial indexing based label and mouse collision detection
* [`sphericalmercator`](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sphericalmercator) for EPSG:3857 <> WGS84 conversions


## Wishlist

* node port of [libdrawille](https://github.com/Huulivoide/libdrawille) - well optimized library, supporting filled polygons

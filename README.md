* Use your mouse or keys to navigate
* Discover the globe or zoom in to explore your neighbourhood
* See Point-of-Interest around any given location
* Use an online map server or work offline with VectorTile/MBTiles
* Highly customizable styling (reuse your [mapbox-gl-style](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-styles)s)
* Compatible with Linux' and OS X' terminals, Windows support via [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/)
* 99% pure Coffee-/JavaScript! :sunglasses:

## How to get it?

* Make sure to have at least [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 4 installed
* Open your terminal!
* Install `mapscii` with

  `npm install -g mapscii`

## How to use it?
#### Basic usage
* Start `mapscii` with

  ` mapscii`


## Behind the scenes
### Libraries
#### Mastering the console
  * [`x256`](https://github.com/substack/node-x256) for converting RGB values to closest xterm-256 [color code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Xterm_256color_chart.svg)
  * [`term-mouse`](https://github.com/CoderPuppy/term-mouse) for mouse handling
  * [`keypress`](https://github.com/TooTallNate/keypress) for input handling

#### Discovering the map data
* [`vector-tile`](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-js) for [VectorTile](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/tree/master/2.1) parsing
* [`pbf`](https://github.com/mapbox/pbf) for [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) decoding
* [`mbtiles`](https://github.com/mapbox/node-mbtiles) for [MBTiles](https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec/blob/master/1.2/spec.md) parsing

#### Juggling the vectors and numbers
* [`earcut`](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut) for polygon triangulation
* [`rbush`](https://github.com/mourner/rbush) for 2D spatial indexing based label and mouse collision detection
* [`gl-matrix`](https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix) for vector and matrix operations
* [`breseham`](https://github.com/madbence/node-bresenham) for line calculations
* [`sphericalmercator`](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sphericalmercator) for [EPSG:3857](http://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/6864/) <> [WGS84](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/) conversions
* [`tilebelt`](https://github.com/mapbox/tilebelt) for some [slippy map tilename](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames) calculations

#### Handling the flow
* [`bluebird`](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) for all the asynchronous [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) magic
* [`request-promise`](https://github.com/request/request-promise) for promisified HTTP request handling

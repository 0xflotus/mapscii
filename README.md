# MapSCII - the whole world in your console.

No web browser around? Don't worry - and discover the planet in your console!

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/yYVt7No.png" width="100%" />

* Discover the globe or zoom in to explore your neighbourhood
* See Point-of-Interest around any given location
* Highly customizable styling (reuse your [mapbox-gl-styles](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-styles))
* Compatible with Linux and OSX terminals, Windows support via [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/)
* Use the default or your own map server - or work offline with VectorTile/MBTiles
* 99% pure Coffee-/JavaScript! :sunglasses:

## How to install

If you haven't already got Node.js >= version 4, then [go get it](http://nodejs.org/).

```
npm install -g mapscii
```

If you're on OSX, or get an error about file permissions, you may need to do ```sudo npm install -g mapscii```

## Running

This is pretty simple too.

```
mapscii
```

## Keyboard shortcuts

* Arrows **up**, **down**, **left**, **right** to scroll around
* Press **a** or **z** to zoom in and out
* Press **q** to quit

## Mouse control

If your terminal supports mouse events you can drag the map and use your scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

## Behind the scenes
### Libraries
#### Mastering the console
  * [`x256`](https://github.com/substack/node-x256) for converting RGB values to closest xterm-256 [color code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Xterm_256color_chart.svg)
  * [`term-mouse`](https://github.com/CoderPuppy/term-mouse) for mouse handling
  * [`keypress`](https://github.com/TooTallNate/keypress) for input handling

#### Discovering the map data
* [`vector-tile`](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-js) for [VectorTile](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/tree/master/2.1) parsing
* [`pbf`](https://github.com/mapbox/pbf) for [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) decoding
* [`mbtiles`](https://github.com/mapbox/node-mbtiles) for [MBTiles](https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec/blob/master/1.2/spec.md) parsing

#### Juggling the vectors and numbers
* [`earcut`](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut) for polygon triangulation
* [`rbush`](https://github.com/mourner/rbush) for 2D spatial indexing based label and mouse collision detection
* [`gl-matrix`](https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix) for vector and matrix operations
* [`breseham`](https://github.com/madbence/node-bresenham) for line calculations
* [`sphericalmercator`](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sphericalmercator) for [EPSG:3857](http://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/6864/) <> [WGS84](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/) conversions
* [`tilebelt`](https://github.com/mapbox/tilebelt) for some [slippy map tilename](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames) calculations

#### Handling the flow
* [`bluebird`](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) for all the asynchronous [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) magic
* [`request-promise`](https://github.com/request/request-promise) for promisified HTTP request handling
* [`userhome`](https://github.com/shama/userhome) to determine where to persist downloaded tiles
